# lambda-contact-form
A lambda function used as the endpoint for the contact form on my website.

Since moving my website from Wordpress to Gatsby.js I have been using FormSpree.io for my contact form. 

However, I wanted to keep everything on my own domain and needed an excuse to play around with AWS Lambda.

This function is based off of my [lamda-dotnet-console](https://github.com/hyettdotme/lamda-dotnet-console) project.
